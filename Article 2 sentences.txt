Life is almost back to normal in much of China  
Shops, restaurants, bars, and offices are open  
Manufacturing activity is picking up  
Traffic once again jams the highways of major cities  
Threequarters of China’s workforce was back on the job as of 24 March, according to one company’s estimate  
Wuhan, where the COVID-19 pandemic originated, is lagging, as is the rest of Hubei province—but even there, the lockdown is set to lift 8 April  
China has done what few believed was possible: Bring a blazing epidemic of a respiratory virus to a virtual standstill  
On 18 March, the country reported zero locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for the first time  
Since then, only eight such infections have been reported, only one of them in Wuhan  
Now, the key question is: Can China keep it that way? Public health experts worldwide are watching closely  
“China is addressing an issue every country and location in the world will eventually face: how to normalize and restore societal activities, while at the same time minimizing disease-related dangers from the outbreak,” says epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda of the University of Hong Kong (HKU)  
New infections now mostly come from outside—623 cases have been confirmed in incoming air passengers between 18 and 30 March  
At midnight on 27 March, China banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country and required returning Chinese to be quarantined for 2 weeks, whether coming by air or over land  
But there is still danger at home as well  
The smattering of locally transmitted cases shows SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, isn’t entirely gone  
And the low case numbers may be deceptive  
Until early this week, tallies from China’s National Health Commission did not include people who tested positive for the virus but had no symptoms, and local authorities have reportedly suppressed data on new infections to meet the target of zero local cases  
Still, “I believe that there are few local cases,” says HKU epidemiologist Ben Cowling  
But with most of the population still susceptible to infection, fresh outbreaks remain a constant danger  
“How to balance getting back to work and a normal state versus maintaining the current status [of few new cases] is certainly critical,” says Ding Sheng, director of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute at Tsinghua University  
Officials are relaxing restrictions slowly and methodically, Ding says  
Many restaurants at first reopened with shortened hours and for a limited number of customers; now, doors are open to all  
Primary and secondary schools in several provinces have reopened, but only in communities free of the disease, and schools must check students’ temperatures and watch for symptoms  
Universities, where students from around the country mix, remain closed  
Events that draw crowds are still banned or discouraged  
Live music venues and gyms in many cities remain closed  
There are temperature checks at subway entrances and factory gates  
And habits developed during the epidemic persist  
Face masks are ubiquitous  
People keep their distance in public and at work  
Millions continue to work from home  
To guard against flare-ups, investigators trace and quarantine close contacts of every newly confirmed COVID-19 case, including those who may be asymptomatic, Wu Zunyou, an epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), told the communist party newspaper China Daily last week  
In another precaution, everyone visiting fever clinics in Beijing and other major cities is now tested for the virus  
And many provinces check the health status of migrant workers and others crossing their borders  
“Any new transmission will be identified quickly and controlled swiftly,” Ding says  
The 27 March travel ban—which the government implemented even though it strenuously objected when the United States banned visitors from China in January— addresses the other main risk: reintroduction of the virus from the rest of the world  
Flights into China have also been severely curtailed  
Chinese citizens who arrive undergo strict screening en route and upon arrival and go into quarantine for 2 weeks  
A European academic who returned to China 1 week before the ban took effect described the process to Science  
His temperature was taken twice during the flight and he filled out a form detailing his recent whereabouts, the health status of family members and colleagues, and his use of medications  
Another temperature check followed at the Beijing airport, after which the scholar—who asked not to be identified—was escorted to his own apartment for a 14-day quarantine  
A community official pasted a quarantine notice across the door jamb, which was removed and replaced for grocery deliveries  
Authorities ordered him to a “quarantine hotel” 3 days later, after a fellow passenger on the plane turned positive for COVID-19  
The academic remains “very understanding,” and says he was treated well  
China’s strategy “seems to have been effective thus far in preventing a resurgence,” says Benjamin Anderson, an epidemiologist at Duke Kunshan University  
But with the virus now circulating around the world, “repeated importations to China will inevitably lead to local transmission,” Cowling says  
“Authorities will need to get on top of the cases very quickly,” he says, in a game of whack-a-mole  
Remaining pockets of local infection could be a problem as well, says Ira Longini, a disease modeler at the University of Florida  
“The models say the disease will come back once the restrictions are lifted  
I hope that’s not correct, but I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be,” Longini says    
Economists predict China’s gross domestic product may shrink 10% in the first quarter of this year, the worst contraction since 1976, and demand for China’s manufactured goods has collapsed  
The Chinese strategy is aimed at buying time until a vaccine or drugs are available, says George Gao, director of China CDC  
A group led by Chen Wei of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences has already started a phase I study of a candidate vaccine, according to China Daily  
Dozens of other vaccine studies are underway around the world
Ding, who lived in Beijing through the worst of the crisis, believes China can keep its guard up until these efforts bear fruit  
Although minor flare-ups could happen any time, he says, a large-scale reemergence of COVID-19 “is very unlikely given what we have learned.”
