The United States is first, and not in a good way  
Last week, it set a grim record, surpassing all other nations in the reported number of people infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19  
Officials had documented nearly 200,000 cases as Science went to press on 31 March; the death toll neared 4000  
Even President Donald Trump—who just 1 month ago claimed the virus was “very much under control”— warned that the pandemic is about to get much worse  
To limit the damage, Trump on 29 March announced that federal recommendations to practice physical distancing would remain in place at least through the end of April, dropping his much-criticized push for a faster return to business as usual  
In the meantime, officials across the nation are scrambling to find enough ventilators, protective gear, and supplies for hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients—or about to be (see graph, below right)  
Many state governors ratcheted up restrictions intended to slow the pandemic, imposing stay-at-home orders that some said could last into June  
Despite such actions, the U.S  
pandemic response remains a work in progress— fragmented, chaotic, and plagued by contradictory messaging from political leaders  
“We don’t have a national plan,” says epidemiologist Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities  
“We are going from press conference to press conference and crisis to crisis … trying to understand our response.” Others are dismayed that the U.S  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has prominently provided national leadership in past outbreaks, hasn’t been more visible  
“I sure would like to see a lot more of CDC,” says Julie Gerberding, a former director of the agency  
The United States is “in a reactive mode,” says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development  
“We’re still chasing the virus.” To catch up, Osterholm and other researchers have released a flurry of battle plans in the past week  
Many officials have welcomed the recommendations and signaled their support  
But the question now is whether the United States —a patchwork of more than 50 state and territorial governments marked by political polarization and a history of fierce resistance to centralized authority—can follow through  
The urgency is great  
A review of 12 mathematical models conducted by federal scientists concluded the United States is likely to see millions of people infected  
The death toll is now likely to reach more than 100,000 (see graph, below right) even with distancing and other measures, Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, has said repeatedly  
Some experts fear even those numbers are too optimistic, given that outbreaks are now poised to explode in places—including Louisiana, Michigan, and Florida—that are ill-prepared for the surge of people needing hospitalization  
The new battle plans generally agree several moves need to be taken immediately  
Federal, state, and local governments must consistently urge, if not order, most people to stay home and keep their distance from others  
Federal officials must take a stronger role in directing medical supplies to areas most in need  
Testing for the virus must accelerate and expand, so that people who are infected can be quarantined  
But there are numerous obstacles  
Testing could soon be hampered by a shortage of reagents, caused in part by the disruption of supply chains in Asia, Osterholm notes  
Instead, health officials may have to rely on less precise illness surveillance— documenting the frequency of COVID-19 symptoms to estimate the number of cases  
Persuading more than 320 million Americans to take the pandemic seriously, meanwhile, will require a radical change in messaging from political leaders at every level, from the White House to city halls  
“Rule one of communication in a pandemic is have a message and stick to it,” says politi cal scientist Scott Greer of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who has studied the U.S  
response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic  
So far, that’s been the exception, as Trump and state and local officials have delivered a cacophony of conflicting messages, from indifference to alarm  
Even if lockdowns succeed at halting the virus, as they have in China, the country needs to marshal massive resources to monitor for new outbreaks and quickly contain them, Konyndyk says  
Identifying cases and contacts and isolating them will require a huge increase in public health workers at the local level  
“Most of what we would need to do to transition away from large-scale social distancing is not in place, and there don’t appear to be plans to put it in place,” he says  
The absence of nationwide coordination highlights the division of legal power between the federal and state governments, observers say  
Governors, not federal officials, typically hold police powers to shut businesses and enforce curfews  
But many are reluctant to invoke those powers and suffer the political costs without clear direction from above, Greer says  
Political division over the pandemic has also hampered decisive action: Polls show Republicans perceive the threat as less serious than Democrats and independents  
To see the consequences of such divides, Greer points to Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis (R) delayed ordering a statewide closure of beaches, apparently unwilling to cross the powerful tourism industry— and his political base  
DeSantis “is dependent on a large bloc of voters who are Republicans and many are very pro-Trump  
If I’ve got Donald Trump saying essentially, ‘Don’t lock down,’ what political cover do I have?” Greer says  
Epidemiologists predict the delay will worsen Florida’s outbreak  
New research suggests partisan leanings are influencing pandemic response in other states, too  
In a preprint released on 28 March, researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle, found that states with a Republican governor or where Trump fared better in the 2016 election were less likely to have instituted a range of social distancing measures than states led or dominated by Democrats  
Bridging such divisions will be essential if the United States is to defeat the coronavirus, says Harvard University epidemiologist William Hanage  
“The closest comparison here, in terms of national mobilization, is a war  
And there is no way the United States would fight a war as 50 separate states.”
